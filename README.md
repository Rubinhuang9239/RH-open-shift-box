## Building and running on localhost

I assume you have Node.js and NPM installed. :)

First install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Run with Webpack Dev Server ðŸ‘ˆ

```sh
npm start
```

To create a production build:

```sh
npm run build-prod
```

To create a development build:

```sh
npm run build-dev
```
